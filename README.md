Hello, I’m Zam <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" />
.

I’m a computer science student based in France.

I’m currently learning programming and web development, and I enjoy progressing step by step through hands-on practice.
When I learn something new, I try to apply it by building small projects.

My main tools are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, and Java.
I also use Git and Figma while working on my projects.

I’m building my GitHub as a place to track my learning and share my progress.
